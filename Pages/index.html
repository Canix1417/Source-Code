        <h1>What is 28:19?</h1>
        <h4>
            28:19 is an online space that connects those in Christian ministry who are in need of financial aid, to people of varying backgrounds with a desire to give.
            As Christians who have been active on both sides of fundraising, we realize how difficult it can be to fundraise for mission/ministry. Similarly, we know what it's like
            to want to practice the virtue of generosity by supporting missionaries and believers in need, but not be aware of any in our church or community. Our desire is 
            that this website would change the lives of it's users and visitors. 
            
            <br><br>Receiving support and encouragement in your vocation does make a difference and has an eternal impact. Similarly giving molds our hearts to 
            look more like Christ and also has an impact on eternity. All we've done is set up a secure website to connect each party: givers and receivers. Our genuine 
            prayer is that through this website God uses you, and others, to bring Glory to Him and change the world one life at a time.     
            
            <br><br>Now that you have a glimpse into what we are trying to accomplish through the wesbite, you're probably wondering <b>what's next?</b> Great question!
            If you want to start giving soon, check out our Getting Started page for supports. On the other hand, if you are in need of finances for ministry, start with our Getting Started page for Missionaries. 

            <br>Regardless of your role, thank you for trusting us. The Lord bless you and keep you!

            <h4> 28:19 originally was created in 2022 by Addison Cahill. At the time, Addison was preparing to leave for YWAM Kona. With 2 months before his depature date,
                it was unlikely Addison would be able to find a job. With that being said, Addison decided that he wanted to pursue his passion for web development and create his
                first website from scratch! All he needed to decide was what he wanted the websites content to be. Easy! Since he was about to spend a season being a missionary himself 
                - and facing needing to fundraise a lot of money before leaving
