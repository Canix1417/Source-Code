            The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must 
            give as he has decided in his hear, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. <br>&emsp; 2 Corinthians 9:6-7

                When you give to someone in need, you submit yourself to Jesus' character over your own. Additionally, you are sharing in the missionary work of the individual you supported.
                Let's say the missionary you donate to goes onto to show Christ to 5 individuals who accept Jesus as their savior, we believe that you played a role in bringing
                those individuals to Christ and therefor, have built up reward in Heaven for your obedience.

        <h1>Giving Testimonies!</h1>
        <p><em>When I give, I'm never dissapointed. This act of surrender, sometimes big, somtimes small, makes a noticeable change in my heart to be more generous with not only my money 
            but also my time. 
        </em></p>

        <p><em>Giving was something I always knew I should be doing but never actually put into practice until recently. Before, I was 
            operating out of a fear of lacking. This fear told me that I wasn't successful enough to give  - despite scripture suggesting otherwise. The incredible thing is that
            now that I have started giving financially, God has moved in my finances and made sure I haven't had to lack. If you're afraid to give, take the jump. You won't regret it :) 
        </em></p>

        <p><em>Let's face it, giving graciously can often seem counter-culture in this day in age. Sure, there are amazing websites and programs out there where
            individuals can go and give to others. The reason why giving felt counter-cultural to me and could feel that way to you is because of how media portrays self-love and 
            happiness that can only be found in consumption. Think about it, how often do commercials, songs, and other forms of media hint (or outright say) that you would be happier
            and more fulfilled if you just had more.
